Music Time Machine 

The "Music Time Machine" is a Python-based project designed to create personalized Spotify playlists 
by scraping Billboard's Top 100 charts for specific dates, such as anniversaries or birthdays.
Using Beautiful Soup for web scraping and the Spotify API for playlist creation,
the tool automates the process of generating playlists that reflect the most popular songs on meaningful dates, 
offering a nostalgic musical experience.
